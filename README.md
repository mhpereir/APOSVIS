# Welcome to APOVIS: a project for visualizing the APOSTLE cosmological simulations

This is a Django website that allows you to visualize galaxies from cosmological simulation data using sph-viewer (http://alejandrobll.github.io/py-sphviewer/). With this website, you can explore and analyze the properties of galaxies in the simulated volumes of the APOSTLE cosmological simulations, such as their size, shape, but also track their evolution through time!

This website provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the simulation data. You can easily navigate through the different galaxy catalogs and view the gas, dark-matter, and stellar properties of individual galaxies and their satellite companions.

I hope that this website will be a useful tool for researchers, educators, and anyone who is interested in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe. Please feel free to explore and experiment with the website, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements.
